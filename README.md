## 🚀 Developing Extensions

Each extension is a standalone VS Code extension project.

To work on an extension:

```bash
cd extensions/extension-name
npm install
npm run compile   # or 'npm run build', depending on setup
# Or use VS Code's "Run Extension" (F5) to test in the Extension Development Host
