# Contributing to Super Cool VS Code Tools

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🚀  
We welcome all kinds of contributions—bug fixes, new features, new extensions, tests, docs, and ideas.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo** and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Pick an extension** inside the `extensions/` folder to work on, or start a new one!
3. **Install dependencies and set up your development environment:**
    ```bash
    cd extensions/extension-name
    npm install
    ```
4. **Test your changes:**
    - Use VS Code’s “Run Extension” (F5) feature to test your extension in a development host.
5. **Commit and push your changes:**
    - Please follow clear commit message practices, e.g.:
      - `fix: ...`
      - `feat: ...`
      - `docs: ...`
6. **Open a Pull Request:**
    - Describe what you changed and why.
    - Link to any relevant issues.

## ✨ Code Style

- Please keep your code clean and well-commented.
- Follow existing formatting and patterns where possible.
- Each extension should have its own `README.md` explaining setup and usage.

## 🐞 Reporting Issues

- If you find a bug or want to request a feature, [open an issue](../../issues)!
- Be as detailed as possible—steps to reproduce, logs, screenshots, and your environment info all help a lot.
